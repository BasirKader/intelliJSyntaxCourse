Disadvantages:
   1)classes get tightly coupled
class Dog{
String name;
static in legs=4;
//concrete class
}

public abstract class Phone{
String make;
String model;
static boolean has5G=true;
}
Rules:
Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do,but we cant create
their objects directly and if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must be either
provide the implementation for th e abstract method or it must be declared abstract.
1)we cant have final and abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
2)we cant have static and abstract keywords with a methods at the same time.
3)abstract keyword with fields not allowed.

Interface:
Interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in java
we can create an interface wth the keyword interface.

interface Human{
public static
}
