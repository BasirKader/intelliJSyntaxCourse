Wrapper classes:
they are object type for all the primitive types.When we use the wrapper classes
we get all the benefits of classes and objects for example we can have methods.
also generics works with only classes.
Boxing in wrapper classes:
boxing happens when we convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
int num=10;
Integer num2=new Integer(num)//boxing
unboxing happens when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
Integer num2=new Integer(10)
int num=num2.intValue();

Integer num=10;//autoBoxing
int num2=num;//auto unboxing
List (it is an interface in collections frame which is implemented by two classes
ArrayList LinkedList

1)we can store the duplicate values in lists
2)insertion order is maintained
When to use ArrayList:
if most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or
changing the position of data then we should go with array list.
When to use LinkedList:
when most of the operations related to changing the position or related to data
shifting then we should go with LinkedList.
