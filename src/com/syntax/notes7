Collections Framework in Java:
  collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way.
1)ArraysList
    1)This class has many built-in methods like add()remove()clear() etc.
    2)Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time.

ArrayList<>arraylist=new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList==>name of the class
<>==>diamond operator we specify the data type
Wrapper classes
byte==>Byte
short==>Short
int==>Integer
double==>Double
char==>Character

why wrapper classes
1)we get built-in methods
2)a lot of frameworks dont support primitives
when to use primitives:
   when we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to
   wrapper
   2)performance
when to use Wrapper
when we should can about our ease.
