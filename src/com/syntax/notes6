Abstraction in java:
      Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only.
Two methods to achieve abstraction:
    1)Abstract class
    2)Interfaces
Abstract classes:
    abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.
Interfaces:
   Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.
How to decide which one to use:
1)Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes.
2)if two or more classes are closely related to each other go with
abstract classes for example if we have to create a lion class and a horse class
we should go with abstract classes and should create an animal abstract class,
if two classes are not related to each other for example an apple and cloth
we should create an interface for that like if we want to have a behavior washAble.

Encapsulation:
It is the fourth pillar of OOPS,it provides security and better control over the data
of a class.
We create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods.
These methods are called getter ans setters methods and we set and get the values of the
class fields with the help of these methods instead of accessing and modifying them directly
