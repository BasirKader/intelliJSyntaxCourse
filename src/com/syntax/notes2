Method overloading in Java:
when same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters
or different data type of parameters or different sequence of parameters.

Advantages of method overloading:
    Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
    End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names

    Rules:
    we overload the constructors
    we can overload the static methods as well
    we can overload the main method as well

    Rules for static methods:
    Static methods can't access instance fields directly
    instance methods can access instance as well as static fields directly

    Method overriding:
    1)Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the parent class and
    in the child class
    2)we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two classes
    3)we cant override the private methods because they dont participate in inheritance
    4)we cant override the constructors because they dont participate in inheritance
