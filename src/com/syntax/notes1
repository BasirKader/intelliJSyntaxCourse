Access modifiers in java:
access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members (fields,methods,constructors etc.)
and classes itself in java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we used to define these access level fourth
level is applier when we don't us any access modifier keyword.
levels from most restricted to less restricted are
1)private(keyword is also private)
2)default(no keyword means default access level)
3)protected(keyword is also protected)
4)public(keyword is also public)
Rules:
1)we should always prefer private access modifier for the fields,because fields contain the data
and methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks if we don't perform sanity
checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might misbehave also
the access of the data should be restricted so that not every one can access the data.
2)we can't use access modifiers with local variables.

 Constructors
 Constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
