Inheritance in Java:
Its a mechanism in java through which a child gets the properties and methods from a parent class.

Benefits:
     1)Saves time to code
     2)code duplication is reduced
     3)execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
      Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
Types of inheritance:
There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them
     1)single
     2)Heirarchical
     3)Multilevel
     4)Multiple(not supported in java)
Single inheritance:
     In single inheritance we have only one child and on parent class or only two classes participate in
     inheritance one as child one as parent.
class Parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{

}

Heirarchical:
    In heirarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes
class Parent{

}
class Child1 extends Parent{

}
class Child2 extend Parent{

}

Multilevel:
     We have Multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
     Class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A.
Class A{

}
Class B extend A{

}
Class C extend B{

}
==============================================================================
Super Keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can access the fields
method or constructors of parent class inside the child class using this keyword.

Method overloading in java:
if we have same named methods in a class with different number of parameters or different
sequence of parameters or different data types of the parameters it is called method overloading.

}

}
add(int number,int number2,int number3){
