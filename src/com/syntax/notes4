Method overriding in Java:
Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in parent and child class classes.

Benefits:
     1)Flexibility if we don't like something from the parent class we can overrride it
     and can provide our own implementation.
     2)Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.
Rules:
     1)without inheritance method overriding is not possible.
     2)method signature should be same in parent class and in child class.
     3)if something does not participate in inheritance we can override it.
     4)we can increase the visibility in the child classes but we can't decrease it
     for example we can go from default or protected to public ,but we can't do the reverse.
     5)we can't override a static method,but we can redeclare it.
     EX.Main method cant be overridden as it is static.
     6)We can't have different return type in the child class it must be same as child class


     OOPS Main pillars:
     1)Inheritance(code re usability)
     2)Polymorphism(less code dynamic code)
     3)Abstraction(
     4)Encapsulating
