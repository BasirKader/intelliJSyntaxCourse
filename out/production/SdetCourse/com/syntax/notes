Types of variables:
There are 3 types of variables local,instance and static

Class vars{
int age=10;//instance variable
static double weight=25.5;//static

void method(){
String name="Moreed";//local variable

}

}

local variables:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch
or any other block of code it is called a local variable
Instance variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then it is
called an instance variable
Static variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is
inside a class and it has a static keyword with it then
it is called a static variable.
When to use which type of variable
Local variables:
Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables
why because they occupy the computers memory for very,very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served java destroys them.

pros:
save memory
cons:
not accessible outside of methods/blocks of code
Instance variable
when we want to share something in  multiple methods of a class
and the information is expected to be different from object to object
 we should go with instance variables
 pros:
 accessible in all the methods of a class
 cons:
 occupy the computers memory for longer than local variables

 static variables:
 when we know that information will stay same for all the objects
 of a class we should create a static variable for that
 pros:
 single memory location for all objects of a class
 cons:
 stay longer in the memory
 can hold only one value at a time.

 ===================================================

 Access modifiers:
 Access modifiers are keywords in java that define from where a certain variable,
 method or a class etc.can be accessed.
 There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords
 1)private 2)protected 3)public
 Types of access are 4
 1)private 2)default(applied when no keyword is used 3)protected 4)public

 private access(keyword is private):
 when we use the private keyword with any of the variables,methods or classes these
 can only be accessed within that class.

 default access(applied when we don't use any keyword):
 when we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by java to
 those variables methods or classes etc. which means these things can only be accessed
 from the same package.

 protected access(we use the protected class):
 when protected access is applied class members(variables methods etc.)can be accessed
 from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance.

 public access(public keyword):
 public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
